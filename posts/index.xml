      <description>Darktable added a lut3d module a while ago. The module supports loading and applying 3D LUTs (Look Up Tables) that come as Cube or Haldclut files.
Apparently LUTs are quite commonly used in the film industry, which means there are quite a few sites out there where people share their LUTs. For example https://freshluts.com More resources are linked from the Darktable blog post on lut3d.
The great thing about LUTs is that they allow you to quickly apply a style to images similarly to Instagram filters.</description>
